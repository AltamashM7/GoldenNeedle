# Golden Needle architecture

Status: **PLANNED architecture; NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.**

Golden Needle is a CPU-first, webcam-driven embodied-fitness application. The intended runtime uses the user's full-body movement to drive a humanoid 3D avatar while gameplay systems interpret movement separately for world-space action.

## Planned motion paths

Primary body-reproduction path:

```text
Unity Webcam
    -> Pose Provider
    -> Raw pose observations
    -> Canonical Skeleton
    -> Confidence handling / filtering
    -> Rotation reconstruction
    -> Humanoid Retargeter
    -> Player Avatar
```

Separate locomotion path:

```text
Canonical Skeleton / motion observations
    -> Locomotion Interpreter
    -> CharacterController / world movement
```

**POSE != LOCOMOTION.** The avatar may reproduce the user's body motion while locomotion converts actions such as jogging in place, lateral stepping, crouching, or jumping into game-world movement. Real-world physical displacement is not assumed to map directly to world distance.

## Product modules

- **Core / Motion Engine** — provider abstraction, canonical body data, confidence, filtering, reconstruction, and retargeting contracts.
- **Player** — avatar, player-facing state, locomotion, and authority handoffs.
- **Game Flow** — launch, introduction, calibration, control transfer, course transitions, and return to Hub.
- **Hub** — modular home space and course selection.
- **Course System** — lifecycle, course discovery, start/completion handling, and stable player-facing abstractions.
- **Individual Courses** — independently owned fitness environments and content.
- **UI** — menus, prompts, calibration guidance, and results presentation.
- **Cinematics** — authored character introduction and deliberate handoff to live control.
- **Debug/Diagnostics** — development-only observability for pose quality, timing, confidence, and performance.

## Dependency direction

The intended dependency direction is:

```text
pose-provider implementation
    -> Motion Engine abstractions
    -> Player systems
    -> Hub / course gameplay
```

MediaPipe-specific structures stay inside the provider/integration boundary. Player, Hub, and course code consume engine-owned representations and stable abstractions, not MediaPipe internals. Changing the pose backend should not require rewriting game or course systems.

## Ownership and performance

The USER primarily owns Motion Engine work. Other developers can later own separate environments and courses. Scene/content ownership is the primary strategy for avoiding Unity YAML conflicts.

The baseline must run acceptably without a dedicated GPU. Inference must not block Unity rendering, and processing costs must be justified by measured value. Initial environments and visuals should remain simple while the Motion Engine is proven.
